My problem was that the files were only uploaded every other time I ran the Lambda. Of course, this behavior suggests, that there was something wrong the Promises and/or the async/await combinations. Unfortunately, I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand the Promises completely. I once have to dive into it.
Finally, my script works. But it is unsatisfactory not understanding completely what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description></item></channel></rss>
