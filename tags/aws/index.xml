If you&amp;rsquo;d like to use another profile you&amp;rsquo;re able to pass it with the --profile &amp;lt;yourProfile&amp;gt; parameter. However, if you pass an SSO profile you&amp;rsquo;ll get an error like this:

My problem was that the files were only uploaded every other time I ran the Lambda. Of course, this behavior suggests, that there was something wrong the Promises and/or the async/await combinations. Unfortunately, I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand the Promises completely. I once have to dive into it.
Finally, my script works. But it is unsatisfactory not understanding completely what&amp;rsquo;s going on.</description></item><item><title>CDK CodePipeline</title><link>https://baartch.github.io/posts/0005-cdkpipeline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 11:23:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://baartch.github.io/posts/0005-cdkpipeline/</guid><description>It took me almost a day to figure out how to fix a problem with deploying a pipeline with CDK.
